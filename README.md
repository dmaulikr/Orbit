# Orbit
An iOS Game for my Senior Project at Cal Poly

NOTE: This project is outdated.

Orbit was a side scrolling game played on the iPad. You use your finger to control your character which is a circle. Your goal is the complete the level and reach a challenging boss at the end of the level.

Throughout the level you'll encounter procedurally generated obstacles and different enemy shapes like other circles, squares, triangles, and lines. The path of enemies are deteremined by their shape. Ex.triangle will path in a triangular fashion.

As you kill these different enemies, you will recieve credits that will allow you to upgrade you weapon whish will orbit around you.
Enemies can also have orbiting weapons that you destroy. 

An in app. level editor was added to test out custom level creation and explore the potential of giving users a level editor in a mobile game.
